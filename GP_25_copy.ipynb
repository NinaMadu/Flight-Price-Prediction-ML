        "Nowadays Predicting airline ticket pricing is essential for passengers and airlines in the dynamic travel industry. Accurately predicting ticket prices is still difficult due to the many variables that affect them, including airline, destination, and travel date. This project focuses on predicting airline ticket prices using a machine learning approach to help better understand the factors affecting these prices and to provide more accurate price estimations.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, we employ two popular machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. We leverage an extensive Indian airline ticket price dataset from Kaggle, containing 300,261 entries across 11 features.\n",
        "These features provide a comprehensive foundation for analyzing the various factors influencing ticket prices and evaluating the performance of each algorithm. Through this approach, we aim to determine the most effective model for predicting ticket prices and gain insights into the underlying dynamics of airline pricing."

        "# Literature Survey :\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem of predicting flight prices has been addressed extensively in machine learning. Researchers and machine learning engineers have studied various algorithms and preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance. According to the researchers, this literature survey helps us select suitable approaches for this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most projects based on this problem have used the same techniques to handle missing values. Dropping null value records is the most common technique.[1] The other techniques are imputing the missing values and filling them with a mean or median according to the problem and the dataset.\n",
        " In most cases, box plots are used to identify the outliers. They use the Seaborn library for data visualization. After identifying the outliers, most of them use two techniques to treat outliers. Among those two, capping is recommended, and trimming is also used in some projects. But when using trimming, they were able to reach good performance when training.\n",
        "\n",
        " In this data set, there are few categorical features and those have been handled in the projects using various techniques. The one-hot encoding is used in most cases where categorical features have several unique values. To handle the features that have two unique values, binary encoding have used. And also when we look through the data there are different scales between data. Therefore most of the projects have used standardization or normalization to achieve feature scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        " When we look at the machine learning models that were used for this type of question the best performance can be seen with random forest models. Some projects have used linear regression and they also have got good performance scores.\n",
        "\n",
        " We have done this survey using Kaggle and the other websites related to machine learning projects. Most of the projects have used root mean squared error and mean absolute error to examine the performance of the model. The concepts from multiple initiatives are combined in this literature survey to provide a solid approach to solving the airline ticket price prediction problem."

        "In this project, two models have been used for predicting flight prices. Those are linear regression and Random forest algorithm. According to our observations on the evaluation matrices, the linear regression has shown a 0.9286 value on the training set and 0.9264 on the test set. This can be considered as a good performance for predicting flight ticket prices. The difference between the training score and testing score is 0.0022, Therefore we can conclude that the model is not overfitted or underfitted on the data set. The linear model can be considered as a suitable model for this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, we used random forest model for prediction. It is an ensemble model and does not require more pre-processed data for that. Using our data we could get a 0.9450 score on training data and 0.9397 score on test data. This gives an incredible score on this problem. This means the model has not underfitted on the data frame. According to the difference between those scores (0.0053), we can see the model has not overfitted.\n",

        "Therefore we can conclude that random forest is the best fitting model for this problem and it makes random forest the most suitable model for this problem."
